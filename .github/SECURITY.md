# Security Policy

## Our Commitment to Security

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, 
including all source code repositories managed through our version control systems. 
We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and users who help us maintain 
the security and integrity of our projects.

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have discovered a security vulnerability in any of our 
repositories, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly.

### Reporting Guidelines

Please provide as much of the following information as possible to help us 
understand and address the potential security issue:

- **Issue Type**: Specify the type of vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow, 
  SQL injection, XSS, remote code execution)
- **Affected Components**: 
  - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
  - The specific location of the affected source code 
    (include tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Reproduction Details**:
  - Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  - Detailed, step-by-step instructions to reproduce the vulnerability
  - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible and safely shared)
- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Potential consequences of the vulnerability
  - How an attacker might potentially exploit the issue
  - Estimated severity and potential attack vectors

### Reporting Channels

Please report security issues to support@cavebatsofware.com

### What to Expect

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24-48 hours
2. Our security team will investigate and validate the report
3. We will keep you informed about the progress of addressing the issue
4. We may request additional information if needed

### Responsible Disclosure

We are committed to working with security researchers to:
- Verify the vulnerability
- Address and remediate the issue promptly
- Provide appropriate credit for responsible disclosure (if desired)

## Scope

This security policy applies to all repositories under our organization, 
including but not limited to:
- Main product repositories
- Open-source libraries
- Supporting tools and utilities

## Out of Scope

The following are typically not considered security vulnerabilities:
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without a clear path to exploitation
- Social engineering attempts
- Physical security issues
- Issues in third-party dependencies not directly maintained by our team

## Legal Safe Harbor

We support responsible security research and will not pursue legal action 
against researchers who act in good faith, adhere to responsible disclosure 
principles, and comply with all applicable laws.
